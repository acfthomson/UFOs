# UFOs
## Overview
A client needed a webpage and dynamic table built that allowed for in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.  UFO data is stored in a JavaScrit array.  The webpage was built using JavaScript and its table has the ability to filter data based on multiple criteria at the same time  The webpage was customized using Bootstrap.


## Resources
- JavaScript
    - D3.js
- HTML
- CSS

Users can opt to filter UFO data by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape.  One or multiple filters can be used.


## Summary
Overall, the site is clean and visually appealing.  The site opens with an intersting article and visitors are given several options to filter on for UFO sightings.

### Drawback
UFO data is only for dates between January 1, 2010 and January 13, 2010 and is only for sightings in the United States.  This is a limited data set and should be expanded to include all sightings available to date from all over the world.

### Proposed Recommendations
- Filters would be easier to use if there were drop-down menus displaying available criteria
- The website would be even more interesting if there were additional pages incorporated, such as a blog, photos, map of sightings, etc.
